 firt i have created two files one is Simple_Web_Page.html and Style_Simple_Web_Page.css in the first file i have included html code And in Second File i have included css code for styling.
 Next i have add them to stagged using git add .
 Next Commited both files in the master using git commit -m "intialize".
 then created a new branch and called Feature/update-styling using git checkout -b Feature/update-styling. 
 In this Branch Feature/update styling i have changed background Colour in the file Style_Simple_Web_Page.css
 Then saved the changes in the file Style_Simple_Web_Page.css and added to Stagged using git add .
 Then created a new Branch and switched to Feature/add-content .
 In this Branch i have made changes in the file Style_Simple_Web_Page.css .
 Then saved the changes using git add . .
 Then commited the Changes made in this branch Feature/add-content.
 Now switched to branch master then created remote origin by entering the url .
 Then push it to the github using git push origin enter the branch name.
 Again switch the branch to feature/update-styling.
 then push it .
 Again Switch it to the branch Feature/add-content.Then push it in the same way as previous.
then push this branch.
now open github we can see conflict while pushing the branch Feature/add-content.Beacause in both branches in the same file because we have made changes in the same file.
then comparing the files and resolving manually which change we want.
Then after resolving conflict manually then we can merge do merge conflicts 
so finally created conflicts resolved and pushed it succesfully.
